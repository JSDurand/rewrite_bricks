# This is an attempt to rewrite the bricks game, this time adding the rotating bricks.

## Problem
The problem with the rotating bricks is that I want a method to continuously detect
collisions, but it is not found on the internet how to do this properly. And the engines
publicly available just use discrete methods to approximate the situation, which from my
point of view is not satisfactory enough.

# How to play

This is currently at very early stage. Don't expect anything playable for the present.
